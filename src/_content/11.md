Possibly the best business book of 1880 (prove me wrong), [The Art of Money Getting](http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/barnum/moneygetting/moneygetting.html) by P.T. Barnum, the legendary showman and entrepreneur, is full of great material like this…

“It is this go-aheaditiveness, this determination not to let the horrors or the blues take possession of you, so as to make you relax your energies in the struggle for independence, which you must cultivate.”  
  - **P.T. Barnum** , [The Art of Money Getting](http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/www/barnum/moneygetting/moneygetting.html)

Some advice is still effective 128 years later.

### Glen Gary Glen Ross, this one never gets old…


### Walden, another one from 1854

“I say beware of all enterprises that require new clothes.”  
  - **Henry Thoreau** , [Walden](http://www.amazon.com/Walden-Annotated-Henry-David-Thoreau/dp/0395720427)

Walden is about Henry Thoreau ignoring the usual “9-5 life” and taking his own path, building a house in the country and living simply for 2 years. Inspiring for anyone making their own way.

“I learned this, at least, by my experiment; that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.”  
  - **Henry Thoreau** , [Walden](http://www.amazon.com/Walden-Annotated-Henry-David-Thoreau/dp/0395720427)

### Watch the movie Wall Street (and maybe Rudy too)

This one sounds like it was made last week. Was Gordon Gekko running AIG?


### Man in the Arena

“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.””  
  - **Theodore Roosvelt** , [Citizenship in a Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_Arena)

### Need design inspiration? Watch [Helvetica](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0847817/)

I always end up in Photoshop after watching this one.


And finally,

### Frank Sinatra – My Way
