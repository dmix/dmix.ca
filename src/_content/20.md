After my winter vacation had to be rescheduled last minute, I ended up having a few days of free time after christmas. I decided to use this time to start a small side project called **CareLogger** a [diabetes log book](http://carelogger.com).

CareLogger is a tool for diabetics to keep track of glucose levels, blood pressure and when they take medication.

We soft-launched about a week ago and so far 70 people have signed up which we’re really excited about.

### The CareLogger Story

The idea came after me and my collaborator on this project, Nick Van Nuil from [Dalmeny](http://dalmenyonline.com), discovered after speaking to a few people that there was a serious lack of tools online for diabetics. The one that came closest was an expensive windows-only application that had a very difficult to use UI.

So we spent 3 days creating a web application, with the idea of having a tool that will allow people with diabetes to track their illness from any web browser (and possibly a iPhone application in the future, if there’s demand).

### The Plan

Right now we have no plans to charge money or display ads on the application. It was a great exercise in creating a [minimum viable product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) as well as learning how to build a community and helping people manage their illness along the way.

CareLogger originally had the name HumaLogger that came from the name humalog, a name for insulin. But we decided to change it to CareLogger after finding out that humalog is trademarked.

We’d love to hear any feedback. You can try it out using our demo account (username: demo; password: demo) at [http://carelogger.com/](http://carelogger.com/).
