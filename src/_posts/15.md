[![WeeklyBuilder](http://dmix.ca/images/calendar.png)](http://scheduler.integratehq.com)

I implemented a scheduling system into an app this month and I needed a calendar with monthly and weekly views.

There are over 80 repo’s on github for [calendar + ruby](http://github.com/search?type=Everything&language=rb&q=calendar&repo=&langOverride=&x=19&y=14&startvalue=1). Calendars in rails are a solved problem, right? But oddly I couldn’t find one with a weekly view. All of them are either date pickers or monthly calendars.

So I decided to build my own and I’m happy to announce my first plugin: **WeeklyBuilder** [[Github](http://github.com/dmix/weekly_builder/) | [Live Demo](http://scheduler.integratehq.com/)]

The builder creates a horizontal scrolling calendar, mapping events for each day of the week. The layout is fluid CSS and the hours can be switched from business hours to 24 hours.

The code was inspired by [table\_builder](http://github.com/p8/table_builder/tree/master) by [Petrik de Heus](http://deheus.net/petrik) which is a clean way to generate monthly calenders.

### How to Use WeeklyBuilder

First install by downloading the source from [github](http://github.com/dmix/weekly_builder) or via command line:  
<script src="http://gist.github.com/273224.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script> The weekly calendar builder: <script src="http://gist.github.com/273229.js?file=gistfile1.rhtml"></script>  
  The Next/Previous link helper:  
<script src="http://gist.github.com/273231.js?file=gistfile1.rhtml"></script> The controller code: <script src="http://gist.github.com/273232.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script>  
  Example events model:  
<script src="http://gist.github.com/273234.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>  
  The event model only requires 2 attributes: starts\_at:datetime and ends\_at:datetime to calculate width and position on the calendar. To simplify this for the user, I only ask the user for one datetime (starts\_at) and how long it will take to complete, it then calculates ends\_at based on those 2 attributes.

**Example** : [http://scheduler.integratehq.com/](http://scheduler.integratehq.com/)  
_Note_: The demo uses table\_builder for the monthly view and includes a few extra styles on the weekly. Not yet tested on IE6.

**Update (03/06):** Added a truncate\_width method so that long event names are truncated in proportion to the width of the event, this is passed through the week block: |event, truncate|.
