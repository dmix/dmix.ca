One of my favourite parts of creating web apps is being able to make subtle changes to our sales pages and see the impact it has on our signups.

With [CareLogger](http://carelogger.com) being a side project, our time available for marketing is limited. We found conversion optimization to be a good way to spend 30 minutes once a week refining our pitch to customers. It also maximizes the amount of signups so we have access to more people to conduct customer development with.

After these 3 experiments our free signup conversion rate went from 14.5% to 25%, a **72% improvement**.

### 1) Including a pain point in our headline 

When we launched the site our headline said _Keeping Tabs on Your Diabetes Just Got A Lot Easier_:

While this explained in very general terms a benefit of our product it didn’t hit on the real need that people had when they decided to keep a logbook to record their diabetes. Making your life easier is what almost every product promises.

**People weren’t looking for our software because it was easier than what they currently do.** They wanted better insight into their illness so they can stay as healthy as possible.

So we changed our message to _Maintain Your Optimal Health by Keeping Tabs on Your Diabetes_. We also highlighted the most important benefit “Optimal Health” with green.

This change resulted in a **31%** increase in conversion after 1000 trials (our metric was signing up). Not bad at all.

### 2) Changing our signup button from Green to Red

Earlier this week I came across an article by Performable that explained how [changing their call-to-action from green to red](http://blog.performable.com/post/631526233/button-color-test-red-beats-green) increased conversion by 21%.

I had to try it out so that day I set up an A/B test on our homepage call-to-action.

So far we’ve had 600 participants and our conversion rate has increased **34%**.

We generally wait until 1000 trials but so far the results have been pretty significant.

We believe that it was so effective because we used green on many other parts of the landing page and the red just stands out so much more. It’s all about contrast.

### 3) Changing our button text from “Signup for Free” to “Get Started Now”

We also experimented with changing the button text on the call to action to from “Signup for Free” to “Get Started Now”. This one had a smaller effect, after 1000 trials our conversion rate improved by **7%.**

The difference in this one is that “Get Started Now” is an easier sounding commitment than signing up. Signing up also has connotations with paying (our app is free).

Next up we’re going to try alternating the stock photo on the homepage from a male/female couple to a doctor and patient.
