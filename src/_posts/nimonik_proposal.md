## Nimonik 

### Summary

A small project to add full analytics data collection to Nimonik in order to support future business decisions with actionable data.

This will be done by moving away from old-school pageview based analytics to evented and cohort based analysis. We can establish what the goals are early on, but two primary goals could be tracking the ROI of marketing efforts and conducting cohort analysis to identify user groups which are the most valuable to the company. Allowing the company to better focus on:

1. Acquiring more of these specific high-value users with marketing efforts
2. Pleasing them with feature development

Analytics allows you to know who these users are and if the above two efforts are working.

One of the goals is to establish funnels and reports to make data consumption easy and automated for the Nimonik team.

### Proposal

**Step 1: Planning**

- Map out software features and workflows that need to be tracked
- Map out "cohorts" of users 
  - based on factors such as signup source, how long they've been users, level of interaction with the service, etc
- Propose and finalize which trackers to use
  - for ex: Mixpanel / Clicktale
- Strategy to add attribution to conversions and marketing efforts
  - for ex: tag users who came from AdWords or Newsletter

**Step 2: Implementation**

- Set up trackers and events via Javascript
- Add a few example Funnels of various workflows
  - for ex: how many users login -> complete X action
- Uniquely ID users across platforms and browsing sessions
  - see https://mixpanel.com/people/
- Coordinate with mobile developers to add trackers to Android/iOS

**Step 3: ~2 months later follow up**

- Wait until cohort data and funnels are fully populated with data
- Review data from Clicktale after 1-month run
- Conduct a few simple analysis
- Instruct Nimonik on how to take it from here

### Timeline

**Daily estimates:**

- Step 1: 2 days work
- Step 2: 2 days work
- Step 3: 1/2 day or 1 day follow up

Starting times are flexible, just let me know if and when you'd want to start ASAP.

One of the days I could come to Montreal to be in office. Maybe for step 2 or 3.

### Costs

I'm currently consulting with Shoplocket on a daily basis and can offer the same rate. I don't believe in project-based estimates.

$450/day

Maximum 2 days a week.
